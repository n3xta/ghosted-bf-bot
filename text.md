hey

2

no worries if you’re busy
i just thought maybe you’d say something by now

3

i literally saw you online
it said “active 10m ago”

4

you posted
so at least i know you’re alive and selectively silent
which is cool
and fine
and totally not cruel

5

if you want space just say that
are you being emotionally constipated as usual

6

okay
now i’m starting to feel insane
like am i annoying
or is this your way of punishing me

7

reply

8

just say anything
even a thumbs up

9

did you mute me or block me
i tried to check your story and it’s just gone

10

actually nvm
you probably just archived it
not that i checked twice from my alt

11

i told myself i wouldn’t spiral
and yet here i am
rewatching your old reels like a clown

12

i’m literally so chill about this
like disturbingly chill

13

seriously
i can’t see your tweets anymore
are you shadowbanning me irl

14

if this is your way of setting a boundary it’s very modern of you
passive ghosting is so in right now

15

if you died just say that
otherwise this is insane behavior

16

you’re literally logged on and posting memes
how do you have the energy for memes and not this

17

reply
please

18

ok wait
did your friend tell you something about me
be honest
is this because of that one night when i said the thing about my ex
because if so grow up

19

blocking someone mid-silent treatment is actually revolutionary
you should write a Medium post about it

20

fine
you win
i care too much
congrats
enjoy the power trip

21

idk what i’m expecting at this point

22

you know what’s crazy
i’d still take you back
if you texted “lol”

23

this silence is actually abuse btw

24

ok
cool
just text me if you ever unblock me
then we can pretend none of this happened
